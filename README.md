# tensorrt-zoo
common computer vision models and some useful tools base on [tiny-tensorrt](https://github.com/zerollzeng/tiny-tensorrt).

since most of models have complicated pre-processing and post-processing phase, so new model fully supports is time-consuming. so if you have any suggestions, please create an issue :yum::yum::yum::yum::yum:

# Roadmap
- [x] yolov3
- [ ] find some interesting things can done with tiny tensorrt :dancer::dancer::dancer:

# System requirements
CUDA version >= 9.0 is fully test. 8.0 might also work but didn't test.

TensorRT 5.1.5.0

OPENCV version >= 3.0, only use for read/write images and some basic image processing. so version 2.x might work but didn't test'.

# yolov3 sample
see README.md in yolov3
